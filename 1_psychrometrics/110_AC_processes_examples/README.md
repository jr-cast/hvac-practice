### These are examples that can be found on chapter 1.10 of 2017 ASHRAE Fundamentals handbook. 

**Notebooks:**

* Moist Air Sensible Heating or Cooling
* Moist Air Cooling and Dehumidification
* Adiabatic Mixing of Two Moist Airstreams
* Adiabatic Mixing of Water Injected into Moist air
* Space Heat Absoprtion and Moist Air Moisture Gains

I think is better to try to solve them out first manually and with chart 1 (sea-level) prior to use tools and external libraries; thus maximizing learning.
