# 1. PSYCHROMETRICS
Psychrometrics are the study of physical and thermodynamic properties of moist air, i.e.,
the use of thermodynamic properties to analyse conditions and processes involving moist air.

## 1.1 Dry and moist air composition
**Atmospheric air**  --->  Contains gaseous components as well as water vapor and miscellaneous contaminants

**Dry air**  --->  Atmospheric air with all water vapor and contaminants removed. 

**Moist air**  --->  Mixture of dry air and water vapor. The amount of water vapor varies from zero (dry air) to a maximum that 
depends on temperature and pressure. 

**Saturation**  --->  State of equilibrium between moist air and condensed water phase (liquid or solid).  

## 1.2 Standard atmosphere
Temperature and barometric pressure of air varies with altitude and with local geographic and weather conditions.
The standard atmosphere allows to estimate properties at various altitudes.

**Standard values**

Temperature  --->  15CÂ°

Barometric pressure  --->  101.325 kPa

Gravity  --->  9.80665 m/s2

Lower atmophere is assumed to consist of dry air that behaves as a perfect gas

* Specific enthalpy of dry air **( Vda )**

* Specific enthalpy difference of Hs - Hda **( has )** 

* Specific enthalpy of moist air at saturation **( hs )**

* Specific entropy of dry air **( Sda )**

* Specific entropy of moist air at saturation **( Ss )**

## 1.4 Thermodynamic properties of water at saturation (saturated liquid)
Based on ITS-90. For detailed formulas refered to ASHRAE fundamentals, 2017.

The water vapor saturation pressure ( pws ) is required to determine
a number of moist air properties, principally the saturation humidity ratio ( Ws )

* Absolute pressure (saturation pressure)  **( Pws )**
* Vapor pressure ( ps ) can be used in equations in place of pws with very little error: 

		ps = Xws P 

where x ws is the mole fraction of water vapor in saturated moist air
at temperature t and pressure p, and p is the total barometric pressure
of moist air.

## 1.5 Humidity parameters

Basic parameters

* **Humidity ratio _W_ (or mixing ratio)**

Ratio of the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air:

	W = M w /M da

Where equals the mole fraction ratio x w /x da multiplied by the ratio of
molecular masses:

	W = 0.621945 ( xw / xda ) 

* **Specific humidity**

Ratio of the mass of water vapor to total mass of moist air sample 

	Y = M w /(M w + M da )

In terms of humidity ratio:

	Y =  W / (1 + W)

* **Absolute humidity (water vapor density)** 

Ratio of the mass of water vapor to total volume sample 

	d v = M w / V

* **Density** (of a moist air mixture) 

Ratio of total mass to total volume

	p = ( M da + M w ) / V = ( 1/v )( 1 + W )

Where v is the moist air specific volume, m3/kgda

**Humidity parameters involving saturation** (moist air saturation)
* **Saturation humidity ratio:** Humidity ratio of moist air saturated to water at a same temperature and pressure 
* **Relative humidity:** Ratio of water vapor partial pressure in moist air at dew-point pressure and temperature to 
the reference saturation water vapor partial pressure ar dry-bulb pressure and temperature. 
* **Dew-point temperature:** Temperature of moist air saturated at pressure, with same humidity ratio W as that of the
given sample of moist air.  
* **Thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature:** Temperature at which water, by evaporating into moist air at dry-bulb temperature and humidity ratio,
can bring air to saturation adiabatically at the same temperture while total pressure is constant. 

## 1.6 Perfect gas relationships for dry and moist air

When moist air is considered a mixture of independent perfect gases (dry air and water vapor), perfect gas equation (pV=nRT)  can be 
assumed for each.

### Dry Air

	p ( da ) V = n ( da ) RT

### Water vapor
 
	p ( w ) V = n ( w ) RT

### The mixture also obeys the perfect gas equation:

	( pda + pw ) V = ( nda + nw ) RT

###  Humidity ratio (_W_) (p = pda + pw)

	W = 0.621945 ( pw / p - pw )

### Saturation humidity ration (_Ws_) is:

	Ws = 0.621945 ( pws / p - pws )

Where:

pda = Partial pressure of dry air

pw = Partial pressure of water vapor

V = Total mixture volume

nda  = Number of moles of dry air

nw = Number of moles of water vapor

R = Universal gas constant, 8314.472 (kmol.K) 

T = Absolute temperature, K
