# Design process
### Commercial Heating and Cooling Loads
Peak heating and cooling load calculations are imperative for designing HVAC systems.
These calculation affect the size of components which affect costs, comfort, productivity, operation cost and energy consumption of a building (AHSRAE, 2017).

Simplified, **LOADS** = Rates of energy input (heating) or removal (cooling) required to maintain a desired indoor temperature and humidity.

##### Cooling Load Calculation Principles

Cooling loads: Conduction + convection + radiantion heat transfers from building fabric, internal heat sources and system components.

**Factors influencing cooling loads:**
* External --> walls, roofs, windows, skylights, partitions, ceilings and floors.
* Internal --> Lights, people, equipment.
* Infiltration --> Air leakage and moisture migration.
* System --> Outdoor air, duct leakage and heat gain, reheat, fan and pump energy, and energy recovery.

In regards of HVAC loads for commercial buildings, the _Heat Balance method_ (HB) is the most accurate (Larsen, 2012).

To cope with the complexity of HVAC loads calculation, computer programs are used to automate load estimation.
