# HVAC fundamentals

### Definitions 
_"is concerned with heating, ventilating and air conditioning the indoor environment to meet the comfort, health, and safety needs of buildings, occupants and the 
environmental needs of indoor equipments or processes"_ Larsen, 2012

_"is designed to satisfy the environmental requirements of comfort or a process, in a speciﬁc building or portion of a building and in a particular geographic
locale"_ Haines & wilson, 2003

_"technology for indoor environmental comfort. Its goal is to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality"_ Wikipedia

_"the role of an HVAC designer is to design systems that meets projects requirements"_ Understanding project information is critica, along with knowledge of HVAC
optioneering and applicables codes. Larsen, 2012

Haines and Wilson (2003) fundamental understanding of HVAC practices revolve:
* Problem Solving
: A series of logical steps: 1) Define objective/problem (best suitable conditions & optimal proposal), 2) Define & evaluate options, 3) Select and check alternative,
4) Implement: design, construct and operate system, 5) Evaluate: objectives met? room for improvements? 

* Value Engineering (VE)
: Analytical thought process which deﬁnes a problem, proposes solutions, identiﬁes the optimum approach, and ﬁnally presents the solution in a credible and compelling
 way. VE in construction presumes an issues at hand that gets resolves by
 1) Gathering information, 2) Developing alternatives, 3) Evaluating alternatives and 4) Selling the best option.
  
* Codes and regulation

*Fluid mechanics
: Behaviour of fluids, properties, and important relation to thermodynamics and heat transfer.
