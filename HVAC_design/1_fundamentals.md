# HVAC fundamentals

### Definition 
_"concerned with heating, ventilating and air conditioning the indoor environment to meet the comfort, health, and safety needs of buildings, occupants and the 
environmental needs of indoor equipments or processes"_ Larsen, 2012

_"is designed to satisfy the environmental requirements of comfort or a process, in a speciﬁc building or portion of a building and in a particular geographic
locale"_ Haines & wilson, 2003

_"technology for indoor environmental comfort. Its goal is to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality"_ Wikipedia

### HVAC designer, overview of the design process
_"the role of an HVAC designer is to design systems that meets projects requirements"_ Understanding project information is critical along with knowledge of HVAC
optioneering and applicables codes. Larsen, 2012

**Haines and Wilson (2003) fundamental HVAC practice revolve:**
* **Problem Solving**
: A series of logical steps: 1) Define objective/problem (best suitable conditions & optimal proposal), 2) Define & evaluate options, 3) Select and check alternative 4) Implement: design, construct and operate system, 5) Evaluate: objectives met? room for improvements? 
* **Value Engineering (VE)**
: Analytical thought process which deﬁnes a problem, proposes solutions, identiﬁes the optimum approach, and ﬁnally presents the solution in a credible and compelling
 way. VE in construction presumes an issues at hand that gets resolves by 1) Gathering information, 2) Developing alternatives, 3) Evaluating alternatives and 4) Selling the best option.
* **Codes and regulation**
* **Fluid mechanics**
: Behaviour of fluids, properties, and important relation to thermodynamics and heat transfer.
* **Thermodynamics**
: Thermal characteristics of matter 
* **Heat Transfer**
: Energy in motion thru a mass by conduction, from a solid to a moving liquid by convection, or from one body to another by radiation. 
* **Psychrometrics**
: Science of the properties of moist air, i.e, air mixed with water vapor. Control of moist-air condition is a primary objective of HVAC.
* **Sound and vibration** 
* **Energy conservation**

**Factors governing HVAC design by Larsen (2012):**
* HVAC system types available to meet the project needs
* Building owner’s preferences or standards
* Building owner’s budget
* Installed, operating, and maintenance cost of the potential HVAC system options
• Space limitations, both indoors and outdoors, and coordination with architectural, structural, and electrical systems

**Designers must understand (Haines & Wilson, 2003):** 
1. HVAC system design
2. Outdoor climate
3. Comfort requirements 
4. Building construction and suitable system options

**Building and spaces usage (Haines & Wilson, 2003):**
It is also necessary to understand the use of the building and in
most buildings the use of each part. How does this use affect occu-
pancy, activity level, humidity, temperature, and ventilation require-
ments? Designers must have answers to these and many other ques-
tions before they can design a suitable HVAC system.
