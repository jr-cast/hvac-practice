# 1. PSYCHROMETRICS
The use of thermodynamic properties to analyse conditions and processes involving moist air.

### 1.1 Dry and moist air composition
**Atmospheric air**
 : Contains gaseous components as well as water vapor and miscellaneous contaminants

**Dry air**
 : Atmospheric air with all water vapor and contaminants removed. 

**Moist air**
 : Mixture of dry air and water vapor. The amount of water vapor varies from zero (dry air) to a maximum that 
depends on temperature and pressure. **Saturation** is a state of equilibrium between moist air and condensed
water phase (liquid or solid).  

### 1.2 Standard atmosphere

Temperature and barometric pressure of air varies with altitude and with local geographic and weather conditions.
The standard atmosphere allows to estimate properties at various altitudes.
* 15CÂ° = standard temperature
* 101.325kPa = standard barometric pressure
* Lower atmophere is assumed to consist of dry air that behaves as a perfect gas
* 9.80665 m/s2
