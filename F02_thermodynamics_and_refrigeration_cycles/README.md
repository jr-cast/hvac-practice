# THERMODYNAMICS AND REFRIGERATION CYCLES

**Thermodynamics** is the study of energy, its transformations, and its relation to state of matter. 

A **thermodynamic system** is a region in space or a quantity of matter bounded by a closed surface. 
The surroundings is everything external to the system and the **system boundaries** is what separes a system
from its surroundings

Entropy and energy are important in any thermodynamic system. Entropy measuring the molecular disorder of
a system, and Energy with the capacity to be stored or to be transient. 

# 1. Stored Energy 
1. Thermal (internal)  energy
2. Potential energy (PE) 
3. Kinetic energy (KE)
5. Chemical energy 
6. Nuclear (atomic) energy  

# 2. Energy in Transition
* Heat Q 
* Work
* Mechanical or shaft work _W_
* Flow work 
* A property
* A process
* A cycle
* A pure substance

# 3. First law of thermodynamics 
Law of conservation of energy. 

# 4. Second law of thermodynamics
Entropy flow in an open system is irreversible,
