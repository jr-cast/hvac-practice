# THERMODYNAMICS AND REFRIGERATION CYCLES

**Thermodynamics** is the study of energy, its transformations, and its relation to state of matter. 

A **thermodynamic system** is a region in space or a quantity of matter bounded by a closed surface. 
The surroundings is everything external to the system and the **system boundaries** is what separes a system
from its surroundings

Entropy and energy are important in any thermodynamic system. Entropy measuring the molecular disorder of
a system, and Energy with the capacity to be stored or to be transient. 

#1. Stored Energy 

#2. Energy Transition
 
#3. First law of thermodynamics 

#4. Second law of thermodynamics
